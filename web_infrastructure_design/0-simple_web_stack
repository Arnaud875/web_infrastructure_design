Web Infrastructure Design - Single Server
Overview
This document explains a basic web infrastructure for hosting a website (www.foobar.com) on a single server. The design demonstrates how different components work together to serve web content to users.
Infrastructure Components and Flow
User Request Flow

When a user wants to access www.foobar.com, their browser first contacts a DNS server
The DNS server translates www.foobar.com to the IP address 8.8.8.8
The user's browser then sends an HTTP/HTTPS request to this IP address

Server Components (IP: 8.8.8.8)
1. Web Server (Nginx)

Acts as the entry point for all user requests
Handles static content delivery
Manages SSL/TLS termination
Routes requests to the application server
Chosen for its high performance and reliability

2. Application Server

Processes dynamic content
Executes the application logic
Handles business rules
Communicates with the database
Generates dynamic HTML content

3. Application Files

Contains the website's codebase
Includes all necessary scripts and assets
Stores application logic and templates
Houses configuration files

4. Database (MySQL)

Stores all persistent data
Manages user information
Handles data relationships
Ensures data integrity
Chosen for its reliability and wide support

Technical Details
DNS Configuration

Domain: foobar.com
WWW Record Type: CNAME
Points to: Server IP (8.8.8.8)
The CNAME record allows for easier IP changes if needed

Communication Protocols

External: HTTP/HTTPS
Internal: FastCGI between Nginx and Application Server
Database: MySQL Protocol

Infrastructure Challenges
1. Single Point of Failure (SPOF)

The entire infrastructure depends on one server
Hardware failure would cause complete service outage
Network issues would make the website inaccessible

2. Maintenance Limitations

Code deployments require server restart
Updates cause temporary service interruption
No redundancy during maintenance
Scheduled maintenance affects user experience

3. Scaling Issues

No ability to handle traffic spikes
Limited by server's hardware resources
No load distribution capability
Potential performance degradation under high load

Recommended Improvements
Short Term

Implement regular backups
Set up monitoring systems
Establish maintenance windows
Optimize application code

Long Term

Add redundant servers
Implement load balancing
Separate database server
Add caching layer
Integrate CDN services

Conclusion
While this single-server setup is suitable for small to medium websites, it has significant limitations for high-traffic or business-critical applications. Understanding these limitations is crucial for planning future scaling and reliability improvements.
