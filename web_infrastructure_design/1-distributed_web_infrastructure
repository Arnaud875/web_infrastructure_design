Three-Server Web Infrastructure Design
Overview
This document details a three-server web infrastructure for www.foobar.com, featuring load balancing and database replication for improved reliability and performance.
Infrastructure Components
1. Load Balancer Server (HAProxy)

Purpose: Distributes incoming traffic across web/application servers
Algorithm: Round Robin

Requests are distributed sequentially to each server
Simple and fair distribution for similar server capabilities
Other options include least connections, source IP hash


Configuration: Active-Active Setup

All servers actively handle requests simultaneously
Differs from Active-Passive where backup servers wait idle
Better resource utilization than Active-Passive



2. Web/Application Server

Nginx Web Server:

Handles HTTP requests
Serves static content
Manages SSL/TLS termination


Application Server:

Processes dynamic content
Executes business logic
Communicates with databases


Application Files:

Contains website codebase
Configuration files
Static assets



3. Database Server

Primary-Replica Setup:

Primary Node (Master):

Handles write operations
Maintains authoritative dataset
Replicates changes to replica


Replica Node (Slave):

Handles read operations
Maintains synchronized copy
Provides read scalability
Serves as backup
